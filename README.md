## Description
OOP Lab Module: A Java program that determines whether a given year is a leap year according to the Gregorian calendar.

## Installation Requirements
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager like Homebrew for macOS or apt-get for Linux. 

Using terminal commands: 

- Clone or download the repository: 
```Java 
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/LeapYear.git 
```

- Navigate to the project directory: 
```Java
- cd LeapYear 
```
- Compile the LeapYear.java file: 
```Java
- javac LeapYear.java 
```
- Run the program: 
```Java
- java LeapYear
```  

## Application Usage
Once the program is running, it will prompt you to enter a year. The program will then determine whether the given year is a leap year based on the following rules:  
```Java
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, except if it is also divisible by 400. 
```
Example: If you input:  
```Java
2024 
```
The output will be:  
```Java 
2024 - leap year
```

If you input: 
```Java
1900 
```
The output will be: 
```Java
1900 - not a leap year
```
This application serves a very niche purpose and is not easily modified to fufill any other application purpose.
